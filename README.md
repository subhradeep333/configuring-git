<h1>configuring-git with VS-CODE<h1>

I have clone this repo from Github to vs-code 
Through the code (HTTPS):
    git clone https://github.com/subhradeep333/configuring-git.git.

There are 4 types of fileS:
<br>
|-> Untracked files [The files which are made but nor add or commited]<br>
|-> Modified files which are add but later on some changes are made on it, and not commited yeat.<br>
|-> Stached files are the files which are ready for GIT COMMIT.<br>
|-> Unmodified files which does not contain nay changes.<br>
<br>
Now:
It is a modified file for commit the changes.
Syntax for Commit is:
    git commit -m "some messages"
